//! YAML 1.2 parser implementation in pure Rust.
//!
//! **If you want to load to a YAML Rust structure or manipulate YAML objects, use `saphyr` instead
//! of `saphyr-parser`. This crate contains only the parser.**
//!
//! This is YAML 1.2 parser implementation and low-level parsing API for YAML. It allows users to
//! fetch a stream of YAML events from a stream of characters/bytes.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate is [on github](https://github.com/saphyr-rs/saphyr-parser) and can be used by adding
//! `saphyr-parser` to the dependencies in your project's `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo add saphyr-parser
//! ```
//!
//! # Features
//! **Note:** With all features disabled, this crate's MSRV is `1.65.0`.
//!
//! #### `debug_prints`
//! Enables the `debug` module and usage of debug prints in the scanner and the parser. Do not
//! enable if you are consuming the crate rather than working on it as this can significantly
//! decrease performance.
//!
//! The MSRV for this feature is `1.70.0`.
